Project name: RPG Character Creator

Project description: A website where you can create custom characters, see other people's characters, and keep them all organized. I wanted to build this because me and several of my friends have been running a fantasy roleplaying discord server, and I want to develop a full website that will allow the players within the server to more easily create their characters.

Bonus feature(s):
 - Admin users that can "level up" any users characters 
 - Dashboard has a news feed that shows recent character level-ups
 - News feed is responsive, showing "Your character, <character name> leveled up!" instead of "<Username>'s <character name> leveled up!" for a users character
 - Bootstrap styling across web app
